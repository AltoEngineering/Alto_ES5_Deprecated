# Alto-JS
Alto application architecture for JavaScript Web Applications

Alto derives from a rich history of industry leading frameworks and design patterns.  Leveraging modern languages, tools, and api's, Alto aims to bring a coherent application architecture across multiple development communities.  Specifically, Alto-JS's goal is to bring a clean, organized, full solution to writing web applications. 

Every feature.  Every decision.  Revolved around ensuring that Alto provides a clean and structured environment for your applications code.  Its prime focus is architectural design.

All though Alto has been years in the making and is already behind many applications deployed today.  We are just getting started and the future is bright.  We look forward to seeing what you create with it and can't wait to work together.
